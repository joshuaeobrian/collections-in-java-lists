     * make an ArrayList of Integer objects. However, Java will autobox int
     * values so you can put int primitives into a List of Integer objects.

     * @return An ArrayList of Integers, starting at 0 and continuing to n-1

     * of Strings with the reverse of the values in the `strings` argument.
